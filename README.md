# Predicting Taxi Ride Disputes

Using the 2019 NYC Yellow Taxi Dataset from the [data.cityofnewyork.us site](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2019-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/2upf-qytp), and predictive modeling, I intend to build a model that will predict if a taxi cab ride will be a disputed fare. 

This is a work in progress. If you would like to see my current status, check out the dev branch.
